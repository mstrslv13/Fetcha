## Part 3: Remaining Issues (Prioritized)

### üü° HIGH Priority (Should fix before public release)

#### 1. Command Injection via Naming Template
**Location:** `YTDLPService.swift:778-780`
**Risk:** User-controlled input passed to shell without sanitization
**Impact:** Potential remote code execution
**Recommendation:** Sanitize template, escape shell metacharacters
**Effort:** 2-4 hours

#### 2. Missing Sendable Conformance
**Location:** Multiple model classes
**Risk:** Data races in Swift 6, compiler warnings
**Impact:** Future compatibility issues
**Recommendation:** Add `@unchecked Sendable` or properly implement Sendable
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

#### 3. Computed Property Performance Issue
**Location:** `EnhancedQueueView.swift`
**Risk:** O(n log n) on every render with large queues
**Impact:** UI lag with 50+ queue items
**Recommendation:** Cache sorted results using @State
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### 4. Synchronous FFmpeg Detection in AppPreferences
**Location:** `AppPreferences.swift:100-117`
**Risk:** Still has synchronous I/O in computed property
**Impact:** Potential UI freezes when accessing preferences
**Recommendation:** Convert to async method with caching
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

### üü¢ MEDIUM Priority (Can fix in next release)

#### 5. Memory Management in EventBus
**Risk:** Potential retain cycles with observers
**Impact:** Memory leaks over time
**Recommendation:** Implement weak reference pattern
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

#### 6. Missing Process QoS in Some Locations
**Risk:** Background processes competing with UI
**Impact:** Minor UI stuttering during heavy operations
**Recommendation:** Audit all Process creations for QoS settings
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### 7. Test Coverage Gaps
**Risk:** Regression potential
**Current Coverage:** ~15-20%
**Target Coverage:** 60-70% for critical paths
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks
