## Overview
Comprehensive testing framework created for Fetcha (yt-dlp-MAX) release candidate validation.

## Automated Test Suite (XCTest)

### Test Files Created (8 new comprehensive test files)

1. **YTDLPServiceTests.swift**
   - Binary detection with path traversal prevention
   - Process management and zombie detection
   - Signal handling and race conditions
   - Memory management with large outputs
   - Format selection edge cases

2. **DownloadQueueConcurrencyTests.swift**
   - Race conditions in queue operations
   - Max concurrent download enforcement
   - Priority changes during active downloads
   - Deadlock prevention
   - Memory pressure handling

3. **PostProcessingTests.swift**
   - ffmpeg integration security
   - Container conversion with corrupted files
   - Process timeout enforcement
   - Temp file cleanup
   - File permission handling

4. **FormatSelectionTests.swift**
   - Negative and infinity values handling
   - Mixed codec compatibility
   - Format fallback chains
   - Merge requirement detection
   - Consistent format type selection

5. **PathTraversalSecurityTests.swift**
   - Path traversal attack prevention
   - Symlink attack detection
   - File overwrite protection
   - Unicode normalization attacks
   - Command injection via paths

6. **MemoryLeakTests.swift**
   - Retain cycle detection
   - Observer leak prevention
   - Process cleanup verification
   - Large data handling
   - Closure capture leaks

7. **VideoInfoParsingTests.swift**
   - Malformed JSON handling

   - Unicode and encoding issues
   - Deeply nested structures
   - Real-world corruption scenarios

8. **QueuePersistenceTests.swift**
   - Atomic save operations
   - Corrupted file recovery
   - Concurrent save/restore operations

### Test Characteristics
- **Adversarial**: Tests actively try to break the system
- **Edge-focused**: Boundary values and extreme inputs
- **Failure-oriented**: Designed to actually fail when bugs exist
- **Security-conscious**: Path traversal, injection attacks
- **Resource-aware**: Memory leaks, file descriptors, zombies

   - Disk space handling
   - Corrupted preferences
   - Network timeouts

## Test Execution

### Running Automated Tests
```bash
cd /Users/mstrslv/devspace/yt-dlp-MAX\ 2
xcodebuild -scheme yt-dlp-MAXTests test
```

### Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] Complete installation test suite
- [ ] UI/UX validation across all views
- [ ] Test 10+ different video sites
- [ ] Verify all file operations

## Known Test Coverage Gaps
- Actual network downloads (requires internet)
- System-level process limits (requires root)
- Hardware video acceleration
- CloudKit sync (if implemented)
- Third-party extension integration
