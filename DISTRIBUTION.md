```

## Manual Build & Archive Method (Most Professional)

4. Close scheme editor

### Step 2: Archive the App
1. Select **Product** â†’ **Archive**
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Organizer window opens automatically

### Step 3: Export for Distribution
1. In Organizer, select your archive
2. Click **Distribute App**

## What Your Friend Needs

### System Requirements:
- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- About 50MB free disk space

### Dependencies to Install:
```bash
# Install Homebrew first (if not installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install required tools
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

### First Launch Instructions:
1. **IMPORTANT**: Don't double-click the app on first launch
2. Instead: Right-click â†’ Open â†’ Click "Open" in the security dialog
3. This bypasses macOS Gatekeeper for unsigned apps
4. Subsequent launches can be done normally

## Troubleshooting

### "App is damaged and can't be opened"
This happens with unsigned apps. Fix:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/yt-dlp-MAX.app
```

### "yt-dlp not found"
Make sure yt-dlp is installed:
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
which yt-dlp  # Should show path
```

### "ffmpeg not found" 
Make sure ffmpeg is installed:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
which ffmpeg  # Should show path
```

## Making it Even Better

To avoid security warnings, you could:
1. **Code sign** the app with an Apple Developer account ($99/year)
2. **Notarize** the app with Apple (requires developer account)
3. Create a **Homebrew Cask** for easy installation

For now, the direct transfer method works perfectly for sharing with friends!
