yt-dlp-MAX Installation Instructions
=====================================

1. Drag yt-dlp-MAX to the Applications folder
2. On first launch, you may need to right-click and select "Open" 
   to bypass Gatekeeper (since the app isn't notarized)
3. Make sure you have yt-dlp and ffmpeg installed:
   - Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh
   - Run: brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg

Enjoy downloading videos with a beautiful GUI!

Note: This app requires macOS 12.0 or later.
