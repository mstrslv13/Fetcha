# yt-dlp-MAX Comprehensive Test Suite

## Overview
This test suite provides rigorous, adversarial testing for the yt-dlp-MAX macOS application. Each test is designed to actually catch bugs and regressions, not just pass for the sake of passing.

## Test Philosophy
- **Every test must be able to fail** - Tests that always pass are worthless
- **Adversarial approach** - Think like an attacker trying to break the system
- **Edge cases are critical** - Most bugs hide in the boundaries
- **Performance matters** - Slow code is broken code

## Test Files Created

### 1. ThumbnailCachingTests.swift
**Coverage**: AsyncThumbnailView and thumbnail loading system
- ✅ URL change handling and task cancellation

- ✅ Queue priority and reordering
- ✅ Concurrent download limits
- ✅ Format-based save location routing (audio/video/merged)
- ✅ Path expansion and resolution
- ✅ Failed download retry logic
- ✅ Rapid queue modifications

### 6. CookieExtractionTests.swift
**Coverage**: Browser cookie extraction and configuration
- ✅ Multiple browser support (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge)
- ✅ Domain filtering for different sites
- ✅ Cookie file path validation
- ✅ Browser profile handling
- ✅ Running browser detection
- ✅ Special character escaping
- **Bugs it will catch**: Cookie extraction failures, domain filtering bugs, path validation issues

## Running the Tests

### Command Line
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -project yt-dlp-MAX.xcodeproj -scheme yt-dlp-MAX

# Run specific test file
xcodebuild test -project yt-dlp-MAX.xcodeproj -scheme yt-dlp-MAX \
  -only-testing:yt-dlp-MAXTests/ThumbnailCachingTests

# Run with coverage
xcodebuild test -project yt-dlp-MAX.xcodeproj -scheme yt-dlp-MAX \
  -enableCodeCoverage YES
```

### Xcode
1. Open yt-dlp-MAX.xcodeproj
2. Press ⌘+U to run all tests
3. Or use Test Navigator (⌘+6) to run individual tests

## Test Validation

Each test has been validated to actually fail when the implementation is broken:

1. **ThumbnailCachingTests**: Verified by removing task cancellation → tests fail ✅
2. **PersistentDebugLoggerTests**: Verified by breaking JSON encoding → tests fail ✅
3. **PlaylistDetectionTests**: Verified by changing detection logic → tests fail ✅
4. **DownloadQueueAdvancedTests**: Verified by breaking queue ordering → tests fail ✅
5. **FinderIntegrationTests**: Verified by incorrect path handling → tests fail ✅
6. **CookieExtractionTests**: Verified by wrong browser args → tests fail ✅

## Known Limitations

1. **Network Tests**: Some tests mock network calls to avoid flakiness
2. **UI Tests**: These are unit tests; UI testing requires XCUITest
3. **File System**: Tests use temporary directories to avoid side effects
4. **Browser State**: Cannot control actual browser state in tests

## Future Improvements

1. Add mutation testing to verify test effectiveness
2. Add integration tests with actual yt-dlp binary
3. Add UI automation tests for user workflows
4. Add stress tests for queue with 1000+ items
5. Add fuzz testing for URL and JSON parsing

## Critical Bugs These Tests Have Already Identified

1. **Task Cancellation Bug**: AsyncThumbnailView wasn't cancelling previous loads
2. **Session Persistence**: Sessions weren't properly ended on app quit
3. **Path Resolution**: Audio-only downloads were going to wrong folder
4. **Format Selection**: Re-download was using same format instead of allowing change
5. **Cookie Domains**: Firefox cookies needed domain filtering to avoid HTTP 413

## Maintenance

These tests should be run:
- Before every commit (pre-commit hook)
- On every PR (CI/CD pipeline)
- After any refactoring
- When updating dependencies

Remember: **A test that cannot fail is worse than no test at all.**
